# Data Structures Practice

This repository showcases my implementations and explorations of various data structures as part of my learning journey.

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of fundamental data structures by implementing them from scratch.

## Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Linear collections of elements accessible via indices.
- **Linked Lists**:
  - *Singly Linked List*: Each node points to the next, forming a unidirectional chain.
  - *Doubly Linked List*: Nodes contain references to both the next and previous nodes.
  - *Circular Linked List*: The last node links back to the first, creating a circle.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structures supporting push and pop operations.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) structures with enqueue and dequeue functionalities.


## Usage

Each data structure c language, located in its respective directory.
